# Cyber attacks multiclass classification
 Developing a multiclass classification model to detect and categorize cyber attacks based on multiple parameters, enabling informed decision-making to prevent potential threats.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains various features extracted from network traffic. The goal is to classify instances into different categories of cyber attacks.


## EDA

  1. Data cleaning 
  2. Data mining
  3. Multiple data blalancing methods: SMOTE, random oversampling, Undersampling methods


## Models Used

The following machine learning models are implemented in the notebook:

   1. Logistic Regression

   2. Decision Tree Classifier

   3. Random Forest Classifier

   4. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

   5. AdaBoost Classifier

   6. XGBoost Classifier

   7. Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## Evaluation Metrics

The notebook evaluates the models using the following metrics:

   1. Accuracy
   
   2. Precision
   
   3. Recall
   
   4. F1-score
   
   5. ROC Curve and AUC Score

# Results

The notebook provides a comparative analysis of different models based on their performance. The best-performing model can be selected based on accuracy and other evaluation metrics.
