# Cyber attacks multiclass classification
 Developing a multiclass classification model to detect and categorize cyber attacks based on multiple parameters, enabling informed decision-making to prevent potential threats.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains various features extracted from network traffic. The goal is to classify instances into different categories of cyber attacks.

## Models Used

The following machine learning models are implemented in the notebook:

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree Classifier

Random Forest Classifier

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

AdaBoost Classifier

XGBoost Classifier

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## Evaluation Metrics

The notebook evaluates the models using the following metrics:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1-score

ROC Curve and AUC Score

Results

The notebook provides a comparative analysis of different models based on their performance. The best-performing model can be selected based on accuracy and other evaluation metrics.
